# DarQ

DarQ provides a per-app selectable force dark option for Android 10 and above. 

It uses an accessibility service and root or ADB to allow you to pick just the apps you want to use the force dark theme on. Force dark is a hidden option, provided by the Android system, which intelligently inverts light backgrounds to dark, and dark text and icons to light. It allows a majority of third party apps, such as Snapchat, Instagram, and LinkedIn, as well as first-party Google apps which do not have a dark theme to have one. 

DarQ also provides an option to apply the system dark theme (as well as selectable force dark) only after sunset and before sunrise, protecting your eyes when it's most needed. 

Please read the Frequently Asked Questions sections in the app or [here](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/DarQ/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/faq.md) for more information and some answers to questions.
