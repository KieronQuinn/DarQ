DarQ provides a per-app selectable force dark option for Android 10 and above. 

It uses a root or [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) (ADB) service to apply the theme seamlessly and quickly, without needing an accessibility service.

DarQ also provides an option to apply the system dark theme (as well as selectable force dark) only after sunset and before sunrise, protecting your eyes when it's most needed. 

Please read the Frequently Asked Questions sections in the app or [here](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/DarQ/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/faq.md) for more information and some answers to questions
